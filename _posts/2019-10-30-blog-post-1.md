### Water vapor, shortwave heating, longwave cooling
### Boundary layer processes and large-scale circulation build-up

This post is based on Chen and Wu (2019). [The role of interactive SST in the cloud-resolving simulations of aggregated convection.](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019MS001762) *J. Adv. Model. Earth Syst.*, **11**, 3321-3340. doi:10.1029/2019MS001762.
