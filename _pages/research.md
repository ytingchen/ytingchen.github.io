## A minimal recipe for CO<sub>2</sub> radiative forcing
CO<sub>2</sub> increases drive anthropogenic climate change by adding energy flow (so-called radiative forcing) into the Earth system. Even though CO<sub>2</sub> distribution is rather uniform spatially, its radiative forcing is influenced by various environmental factors and is thus highly inhomogeneous. These spatiotemporal variations in CO<sub>2</sub> forcing have distinctive implications on large-scale circulation, poleward energy transports, and regional climate changes. However, climate models typically do not distinguish between the radiative perturbation caused by CO<sub>2</sub> or environmental changes, leading to uncertainties in isolating the forcings, adjustments, and feedbacks.

The figure above [based on <a href='https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-22-0708.1'>Chen et al. (2023)</a>] illustrates the forcing of instantaneous CO<sub>2</sub> doubling calculated with reanalyses at different parts of the atmosphere under all-sky conditions. An assessment of the forcing variability based on reanalyses provides a benchmark for climate models to reference. Through comprehensive analyses of CO<sub>2</sub> opacity across the infrared spectrum, we develop simple regression models that effectively predict CO<sub>2</sub> forcing using only surface temperature, stratospheric temperature, column water vapor, and cloud radiative effects. Each predictor used here encapsulates forcing originating from distinct parts of wavelength-varying absorption properties. Given this, we anticipate that our established analytical framework can be extended to assess the forcing from other greenhouse gases.
