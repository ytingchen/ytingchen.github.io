I'm a PhD candidate in Dept. Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at McGill University, working with [Dr. Timothy Merlis](https://timothymerlis.com/) and [Prof. Yi Huang](https://huanggroup.wordpress.com/). I'm currently visiting the Program in Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at Princeton University, hosted by [Prof. Stephan Fueglistaler](https://fueglistaler.princeton.edu/).

Broadly, I'm interested in radiation and climate change. Radiation and climate dynamics are conventionally viewed as different areas of research, but the intersection of these disciplines has emerged as a key to understanding climate change in response to greenhouse gas emissions. My previous works focus on the radiative effect of CO<sub>2</sub> emission, in which I assessed the intrinsic variability of CO<sub>2</sub> radiative forcing and reconciled different schools of theoretical thought.

Prior to studying at McGill, I got a master's degree at National Taiwan University, where I worked with [Prof. Chien-Ming Wu](http://lcdm.as.ntu.edu.tw/) and studied the coupling of sea surface temperature, convection, radiation, and circulation with a cloud-resolving model.
