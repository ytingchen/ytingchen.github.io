I'm a PhD candidate in Dept. Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at McGill University, working with [Dr. Timothy Merlis](https://timothymerlis.com/) and [Prof. Yi Huang](https://huanggroup.wordpress.com/). I'm also a visiting student research collaborator at the Program in Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at Princeton University.

Broadly, I work on radiation and climate change. Radiation and climate dynamics are conventionally viewed as different areas of research, but the intersection of these disciplines has emerged as a key to understanding climate change in response to greenhouse gas emissions. My previous works focus on the radiative effect of CO<sub>2</sub> emission. I have assessed the intrinsic variability of CO<sub>2</sub> radiative forcing and reconciled different schools of theoretical thought, with the results supported by radiative transfer calculations.Â 

Prior to studying at McGill, I earned a master's degree at National Taiwan University, where I studied the coupling of SST, convection, radiation, and circulation with a cloud-resolving model.
