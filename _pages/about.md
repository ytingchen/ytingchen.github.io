I am a climate physicist with solid training in radiative transfer connecting quantum-scale spectroscopy to atmospheric processes and climate responses to various external forcings. My research covers radiation and climate dynamics. I approach research questions using various tools including radiative transfer models, idealized cloud-resolving models, and comprehensive climate models.

Currently, I am a postdoctoral research associate in the Program in Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at Princeton University, working with [Prof. Stephan Fueglistaler](https://fueglistaler.princeton.edu/) and [Dr. Timothy Merlis](https://timothymerlis.com/) on tropical atmosphere-ocean coupled dynamics with a high-resolution GFDL coupled model, CM4X.

I obtained my PhD from the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at McGill University, working with [Prof. Yi Huang](https://huanggroup.wordpress.com/) and [Dr. Timothy Merlis](https://timothymerlis.com/) with a focus on the radiative forcing and rapid adjustments of greenhouse gases. Prior to studying at McGill, I got a master's degree at National Taiwan University, where I studied the coupling of sea surface temperature, convection, radiation, and circulation with a cloud-resolving model.
